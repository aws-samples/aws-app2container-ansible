AWS App2Container (A2C) workflow automation using ansible.
This is an example of using Ansible to automate the AWS App2container workflow.

Summary
------------
This project demonstrates how to automate the AWS App2Container workflow by using ansible.
It automates the below steps :
  * Checks the prerequisites needed to install AWS App2Container
  * Install AWS App2Container
  * Builds an inventory of applications and analyze the applications
  * Containerize the applications
  * Generate deployments
  * Generate pipeline
  * Deploy the deployments and the pipeline.


Disclaimer
------------
This project is an example of an automation and meant to be used for testing and learning purposes only.
Be aware that the automation is not covered by the AWS free tier.
Please use the AWS pricing calculator to an estimation beforehand.
This playbook is tested on Amazon Linux 2

* An AWS account
* An IAM user . Please refer to the link for more information. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app2container/latest/UserGuide/iam-a2c.html)
* AWS configured profile on the application servers or worker machine.
* An Amazon S3 bucket.
* A running java application

Role Variables
--------------
user:          Sudo user

workspace_dir: Workspace directory where all the work will be saved

awsProfile:    AWS profile configured on the application or the worker server

s3Bucket:      The S3 bucket for application artifacts

deployTarget: The target environment. Possible option ECS or EKS. Default is ECS.

deployEnv:    The pipeline environment. Possible option beta or prod. Default is beta

deploy:       Flag to deploy the generated artifacts. Possible option true or false. Default is true

worker_mode:  Flag to use the worker mode or not. Possible option true or false. Default is true.

containerParameters_containerBaseImage: The base image to use for the container

containerParameters_appExcludedFiles:  A list of paths to exclude while containerizing

containerParameters_appSpecificFiles:  A list of paths to include while containerizing

containerParameters_applicationMode:  Application mode flag . Possible option true or false

containerParameters_logLocations: List of path where the logs are located


Tags Support
--------------
prerequisite: Run task necessary to check the prerequisites needed for AWS App2Container.

install:      Run task necessary to install AWS App2Container

init:         Run task necessary to initialize AWS App2Container

inventory:    Run task necessary to discover the applications on the applications servers

analyze:      Run task necessary to analyse the applications on the applications servers

extract:      Run task necessary to extract the applications

containerize: Run task necessary to containerise the applications

gen_deploy:   Run task necessary to generate the deployment artifacts

gen_pipeline: Run task necessary to generate the pipeline artifacts


Inventory
------------

onPremisesApplicationServer: The list of unique server running unique applications.
If there is one application running on 5 servers, mention one of the server .

onPremisesWorkerServer: Server where all the containerizing step will be done. This server is needed only
if the flag worker_mode is set to true. If the same is false this section has no impact on the run.


Example Playbook
----------------
To run the playbook

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini main.yml -e s3Bucket=<S3 Bucket> -e awsProfile=<awsProfile to use>

To discover all Java applications 

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini main.yml -e s3Bucket=<S3 Bucket> -e awsProfile=<awsProfile to use> --tags inventory

To Containerize a specific application id from the list of applications discovered

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini main.yml -e s3Bucket=<S3 Bucket> -e awsProfile=<awsProfile to use> --appid <>
